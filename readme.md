# Luach
**VERY IMPORTANT NOTE!**  The Luach Application is intented to be a helpful tool to keep track of a womens Halachic dates. ***The Luach Application has no Halachic status whatsoever, and can not take the place of a Rabbinic authority in any matter***. If the app is relied upon for halachic matters in any shape or manner, there is a very high chance that severe trangressions of the laws of Taharas Hamishpacha will occur; many of which carry the penalty of *Kareis*.
## **Entry**

An Entry is a single seeing period.
Each Entry has the following properties:

**Date**

The date of the Entry is the Jewish date during the beginning of the period.

**Onah**

Each Jewish day is divided into two "*Onahs*"; the Night *Onah* and the Day *Onah*.

If the preiod began between sunset and sunrise, the Entry is conidered to have occurred during the Night *Onah*.
If it began between sunrise and sunset, it is considered to have occured during the Day *Onah*.

Luach is able to give you the time of sunset and sunrise for any location around the globe for any date.
Make sure that you have selected your current location on the Settings Screen, and that your device has the correct time and time zone for your location.

If the time of the start of the preiod is very close (within about 13 minutes) of the sunset or sunrise time, it is strongly advisable to contact your Rav to help determine the correct date and *Onah* for that Entry.

**Haflaga**

The number of days or partial days between the previous Entry and this one.
Upon the addition of an Entry, Luach automatically works out the *Haflaga* from the previous Entry.

## **Kavuah**

A Kavuah is a halachic term describing when a women has multiple periods in a recurring pattern.
There are many ways that recurring preiods can be considered to have occured in a pattern.
Here are a list of a few of the more common ones.
* **Yom HaChodesh /  Day of Month** - Three periods that all occur on the same date and *Onah* of the Jewish Month. For example if a period started on the Day of the 4th of Sivan, the Day of the 4th of Tammuz and the Day of the 4th of Av, this is considered a Kavuah of the Yom HaChodesh. Note, it is usually considered a Kavuah in this scenario, even if there were other periods in the days between these dates. As for everything else, a Rav should be consulted.
* **Haflaga / Interval** - Three periods in a row that all have the same interval of days from the period preceding them. For example, if a period started on the Day Onah on the 4th of Sivan, and the next period started 29 days later during the Day Onah on the 2nd of Tammuz, and the following period started 29 days later during the Day Onah on the 1st of Av, and the following period started 29 days later during the Day Onah on the 29th of Av, this is considered a Kavuah of Haflaga. You may notice that to set this type of Kavuah, we need to calculate 4 periods as opossed to the *Yom HaChodesh* Kavuah where just 3 preiods can set the pattern.
* **Yom HaShavuah / Day of Week** - Three periods that occur on the same day of the week with the same number of weeks between them. For example, if a period started during the Day Onah on Monday the 4th of Sivan, and another period started 4 weeks later on Monday the 2nd of Tammuz, and a third period started on Monday 4 weeks later on Moday the 1st of Ellul, this a Kavuah of Yom Hashavuah. Similar to the Yom Hachodesh Kavuah, it usually does not matter if there were any other periods in the interim. Note, even if there were no other periods between these three Monday ones, this is not a Haflaga Kavuah as there were only two periods with a Haflaga of 29.
