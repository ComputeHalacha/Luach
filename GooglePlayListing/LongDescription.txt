Luach is a full featured <em>Vesset</em> calendar application.

It keeps track and automatically calculates a Jewish woman's dates, patterns and times that need to be observed for the laws of Niddah.

All the <em>Halachic</em> specifications that Luach uses for these calculations can be fully customized.

Luach also functions as a <em>Zmanim</em> and Event Calendar, and includes the full set of daily <em>Zmanim</em> for anywhere in the world.
It also includes event management functionality to keep track of birthdays, <em>Yahrtzeits</em>, special dates and appointments etc.

Luach stores all this information locally on your device and it does not transmit this information to anyone.
As a matter of fact, Luach does not have any Internet permissions on your device, and is therefore physically unable to connect to a remote server.

You can protect the private information entered into Luach by protecting Luach with a PIN number. The PIN can be set from the Settings Screen.

For a comprehensive explanation about how to use Luach, see the Luach documentation at <a href="https://www.compute.co.il/luach/app/">www.compute.co.il/luach/app/</a>.

As the app is relatively new, we would greatly appreciate feedback about any issue and about how we can improve Luach.
