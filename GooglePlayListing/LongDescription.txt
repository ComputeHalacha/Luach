Luach is a full featured women's "Halachic" calendar application.

It helps a Jewish wife or Kallah keep track of all the dates that need to be observed for the laws of <em>Niddah</em>.

Luach does a full Halachic analysis of all the information, and is able to automatically calculate:<ul><li>When a <em>Hefsek Tahara</em> can be done</li><li>Which is the correct <em>Mikvah</em> night</li><li>Which are the days that need to be observed with <em>Harchaka</em> restrictions</li><li>Find any possible patterns ("<em>Vesset Kavuah</em>")</li></ul>

Many Halachic opinions are accommodated, and all the Halachic specifications that Luach uses for its calculations can be fully customized.

Luach also functions as a Zmanim calendar, and includes a full set of daily <em>Zmanim</em> for anywhere in the world. This includes candle-lighting times, sedra of the week, all holidays and fasts, Zman Kriat Shma, and many, many others.

It also includes an event and occasion manager to keep track of birthdays, <em>Yahrtzeit</em>s, special dates and appointments etc.

Luach stores all its information locally on your device and does not transmit this information to anyone.
The private information that you enter into Luach can also be protected with a PIN number. The PIN can be set from the Settings Screen.

Luach comes with a built in help system which explains in detail all it's features and Halachic specifications.
