                    This is the screen that you will first come to when Luach first opens.
                    <br> It is called the Today Screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the right, there is a list of days. When Luach loads, the top day is always the current day.
                    <br> By scrolling down you will see the upcoming days. You can also scroll up to see the previous days.
                    <br> There is technically no limit on how far into the future or past you can scroll.
                    <br> You can also scroll through the days by using the arrow buttons on the menu on the right.
                    <br> You can always return to Today, by pressing on the Today button from the menu on the right.

                    <h3 contenteditable="false">Halachic "Today"</h3>
                    As Luach is a Halachic calendar, the correct Jewish Date always needs to be taken into account.
                    <br> For this reason, if the current system time is after sunset for your location, the Today screen
                    will display the following day as "Today".
                    <br> For example, if the time is currently after sunset on Sunday the 3rd of Shvat / January 12th, the
                    Today screen will show, Monday the 4th of Shvat as "Today".
                    <br> The secular date though, will continue to be displayed as January 12th as it does not change until
                    midnight.
                    <br>
                    <br> Due to the above behavior, you may notice that the list of days on the Today screen may look somewhat
                    strange as in the above scenario, the following day in the list will be Tuesday the 5th of Shvat with
                    the secular day shown as the 14th of January - hereby seemingly skipping January the 13th.
                    <br> This is a consequence of the fact that the secular date for Today's box is displaying the secular
                    date at the current time, while the other days box's are all showing the Secular Date at midnight of
                    that date.
                    <br>
                    <br> This behavior can be changed from the <a href="Settings.html">Settings Screen</a>, by changing the
                    "Calendar displays current" setting.
                </div>
                <p>
                    Within the box of each day, you will find some basic information about that day such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The current Jewish Date at your Location</li>
                    <li>The current Secular Date</li>
                    <li>The Sedra of the current week</li>
                    <li>If it is Erev Shabbos or Yom Tov, Candle-Lighting time for your location.</li>
                    <li>Any special information about this day such as Chol Ha`Moed, a fast day etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Under the date, you will see the name of your current location and the times for sunrise and sunset for this day at this
                    location.
                    <br> The location can be changed to almost any place in the world.
                    <br /> To change the location, press on the name of the location.
                    <br> You can also change the location from the <a href="Settings.html">Settings Screen</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the right side of each day, you will find a link to view the full Zmanim information for this day, and a link to view
                    the entire month in the <a href="#MonthView">Month View Screen</a>.
                    <h3>Background Colors</h3>
                    The background color of a day in the Today Screen can be a quick way to see the status of that day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are the possible colors that can be seen:
                </p>
                <div class="divList">
                    <strong>Yellow</strong>
                    <blockquote>
                        If this day is a <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Date</a>, the background color of the day will
                        be yellow and a red flag will be shown. (see screen-shot).
                        <br /> The flag can be pressed to view the details for this <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Date</a>.
                    </blockquote>
                    <strong>Light Red</strong>
                    <blockquote>
                        If an <a href="entries.html">Entry</a> occurred on this day, the background color of the day will
                        be light red and a small label of bold red text with a brief synopsis of the Entry information will
                        be shown. (see screen-shot).
                        <br /> This label can be pressed to view and/or edit this Entry's information.
                    </blockquote>
                    <strong>Light Green</strong>
                    <blockquote>
                        If this day is the 5th day from the last Entry, the background color of the day will be light green, indicating that this
                        day is possibly the first day that a Hefesk Tahara can be done. (see screen-shot).
                    </blockquote>
                </div>
                <h3>Events</h3>
                <p>
                    If you have added any <a href="#Events">Events</a> for this day, you will see the title of the event
                    displayed in that days' box.
                    <br /> To view the complete Event details or to edit the Event, press on the Event title.
                </p>
                <h3>Days from latest Entry</h3>
                <p>
                    You may also see on the Today Screen, a small text label that informs how many days it has been since the last regular Entry.
                    <br /> Keep in mind that the number displayed is the Halachic number of days; where even a small part
                    of a day is also a day.
                    <br /> So for example, if the Entry occurred on Sunday and today is Tuesday, the text will read:
                    <em>3rd day of last Entry</em>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <h3>New Entry Button</h3>
                <p>
                    Press on this button to create a new Entry for this day.
                    <br /> You will be taken to the New Entry screen, with this day, already selected for you.
                    <br /> To understand what an <em>Entry</em> is in the Luach App, see the <a href="entries.html">Entries section</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>New Event Button</h3>
                <p>
                    Press on this button to create a new <a href="#Events">Event</a> for this day.
