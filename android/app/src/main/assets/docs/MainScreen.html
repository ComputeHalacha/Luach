            On the right, you will see a list of days.
            <br />
            When Luach first loads, the top day will be the current day.
            <br /> By scrolling down you will see upcoming days. You can also scroll up to see the previous days.
            <br /> There is technically no limit on how far into the future or past you can scroll.
            <br /> You can also scroll through the days by using the arrow buttons on the menu on the right.
            <br />

            <h4>Halachic "Today"</h4>
            <small>
                As Luach is a Halachic calendar, the correct Jewish Date always needs to be taken into account.
                <br />
                For this reason, if the current system time is after sunset for your location, the Main Screen
                will display the following day as "Today".
                <br />
                For example, if the time is currently after sunset on Sunday the 3rd of Shvat / January 12th, the
                Main Screen will show, Monday the 4th of Shvat as "Today".
                <br />
                The secular date though, will continue to be displayed as January 12th as it does not change until
                midnight.
                <break />
                Due to the above behavior, you may notice that the list of days on the Main Screen may look somewhat
                strange as in the above scenario, the following day in the list will be Tuesday the 5th of Shvat with
                the secular day shown as the 14th of January - hereby seemingly skipping January the 13th.
                <br />
                This is a consequence of the fact that the secular date for Today's box is displaying the secular
                date at the current time, while the other days box's are all showing the Secular Date at midnight of
                that date.
                <break />
                This behavior can be changed from the <a href="Settings.html">Settings Screen</a>, by changing the
                "Calendar displays current" setting.
            </small>
        </div>
        <p>
            Within the box of each day, you will find information about that day such as.
            <br />
            The information has two parts:
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Personal Halachic information</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Daily Calendar Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The current Jewish Date at your Location</li>
            <li>The current Secular Date</li>
            <li>The Sedra of the current week</li>
            <li>Candle-Lighting time for your location, if it is <em>Erev Shabbos</em> or <em>Yom Tov</em>.</li>
            <li>Any special information about this day such as <em>Chol Ha`Moed</em>, a fast day etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Under the date, you will see the name of your current location and the times for sunrise and sunset for this day at this
            location.
            <br /> The location can be changed to almost any place in the world.
            <br /> To change the location, press on the name of the location.
            <br /> You can also change the location from the <a href="Settings.html">Settings Screen</a>.

                This flag will be show if the day is a <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Date</a>.
                <br />
                This means that Luach has calculated that at least part of the day needs
                to be observed with some type of <em>Harchaka</em> restrictions (הרחקות).
                <br />
                Press on the flag to open the <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Dates Screen</a> to view the
                full details and explanation for this flag.
                <br />
                In addition to the textual indication, any day that is a
                <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Date</a> will have it's
                background color shown in yellow.
                <break />
                If you do not want Luach to show this indication, you can turn off the

                <break />
                Please note that by default, Luach does not show the Flagged Date Indicator
                for the first week immediately following an Entry.
                <br />
                This is to prevent clogging up the calendar with Flagged Dates
                that are irrelevant, as this time period (and more) is
                where the strictest of <em>Niddah</em> restriction apply in any case.
                <br />
                You can change this functionality by turning off the "Don't show Flagged dates for a week after Entry"
                setting from the <a href="Settings.html">Settings</a> screen.

                <br />
                As part of keeping a proper <em>Vesset</em> calendar, it is often useful to
                know how many days after the last Entry the current day is.
                <br />
                Luach shows a small indication by every day of how many days this day is after the last Entry.
                <br />
                <strong>Note:</strong> the tally of the number of days displayed, includes both the day of the Entry
                and the current day.
                <br />
                So if the Entry began yesterday, the indicator will read "2nd day".
                <br />
                This is due to the fact that for most of the Halachic calculations related to the laws of <em>Niddah</em> and <em>Vesstot</em>,
                a part of a day is considered a full day.

                When a women is counting the 7 days of purity - the <em>Shiva Neki'im</em>, it

                <br />
                Luach therefore shows a textual indication for each of the seven days of purity.
                <br />
                Luach determines which days are part of the <em>Shiva Neki'im</em>, by when the

                After nightfall of the last day of a successful <em>Shiva Neki'im</em> period,
                a women goes to the <em>Mikvah</em>.
                <br />
                Luach shows an indication on the last day of the <em>Shiva Neki'im</em> that tonight may be a
                Mikvah night.
                <br />
                To show the Possible Mikvah Night Indicator, press the <em>Hefsek Tahara</em> button

                <em>Shiva Neki'im</em> and Mikvah date.

                If the Possible Mikvah Night Indicator is pressed, the Mikvah Badge will be shown instead of the Possible Mikvah Night Indicator.

                <strong>Important note:</strong> If there was a <em>Shailah</em> and a second <em>Hefsek Tahara</em> was done,

                the true Jewish Date for the Mikvah night is the next day after
                the end of <em>Shiva Neki'im</em>.
                <br />
                As most people don't look at the Mikvah night as being on the next day,
                it was decided in Luach to
                show the Possible Mikvah Night Indicator and the Mikvah Badge

                <br />
                To add the Mikvah Badge, press on the Mikvah Button from the daily menu, or
