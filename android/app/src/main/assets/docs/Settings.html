            <strong>Your location</strong>
            <blockquote>
                Luach uses your location to determine what time sunset and sunrise are at your location.
                This is necessary in order to know what the current Jewish Date is.
                <br />
                It also is used to display the correct <em>Zmanim</em> on the Zmanim Screen.
                <br />
                If your location is in Israel, the <em>Yomim Tovim</em>, <em>Sedra</em> of the week, and Candle
                Lighting times will be in accordance to the <em>Minhag</em> in <em>Eretz Yisroel</em>.
                <br />
                NOTE: Luach remembers your location - and all other settings, even when you close your phone.
                This information is stored locally. Luach <u>does not</u> automatically send out any information whatsoever.

                <strong>Editing locations</strong>
                <br />
                If none of the locations in the in-built list match your location, you can add or edit the locations list.
                <br />
                To add or remove a location from the list, from the <a href="MainScreen.html">Main Screen</a>,
                press on the location name to open the Find Location Screen.
                <br />
                You will see a button on the bottom of the screen to add a new location.
                <br />
                When adding a new location, you will need the following information:
                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the location.</li>
                    <li>The exact longitude of the location. You will need the degrees, minutes and seconds. (Google maps can help)</li>
                    <li>The exact latitude of the location. You will need the degrees, minutes and seconds. (Google maps can help)</li>
                    <li>The time zone offset for the location. This is the number of hours that the time zone differs from Greenwich Mean Time. For example, Jerusalem is +2 and New York is -5.</li>
                    <li>The elevation of the location in feet. To convert from meters: feet = meters divided by 3.28084</li>
                    <li>Candle lighting time. This is the number of minutes before sunset, this location lights candles on Friday and Erev Yom Tov.</li>
                </ul>
                You can also edit an existing location that is on the list.
                <br />
                You can do this from the Setting Screen by pressing on the pen icon to the right of the location name, or from
                the Find Location Screen by either pressing the name of your location, or if you do a search for a location,
                next to each location in the search results there will be a pen icon that will allow you to edit that location.
                <br />
                Once you are in the Edit Location Screen, you will also be able to remove that location from the list.

                On <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Dates</a>, besides for the actual
                <em><a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onah</a></em>
                that needs to be observed, many people also observe the previous
                <em><a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onah</a></em> as well.
                <br />
                This is in accordance with the opinion of the <em>Ohr Zarua</em>.
                <br />
                Note, the restrictions will usually be greatly reduced during the Onah of the
                <em>Ohr Zarua</em>.
                <br />
                If you are unsure about if or how to observe the <em>Ohr Zarua</em>, please consult with your
                Rav.
                <br />
                If this setting is turned on, Luach will flag the previous
                <em><a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onah</a></em>
                with an indication this it is for the <em>Ohr Zarua</em>.
                <break />
                Due to it's widespread prevalence, this Setting is turned on by default.

            <strong>Keep Onah Beinonis for a full 24 Hours</strong>
            <blockquote>
                On the <em>Onah Beinonis</em> <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Dates</a>
                of <em>Yom Hachodesh</em>, 30 days and 31 days,
                there are many that do not only observe the
                <em><a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onah</a></em>
                in which the period began, they observe the entire 24 hour period.
                <br />
                This is NOT the same as the <em>Ohr Zarua</em> - the previous Onah.
                The <em>Ohr Zarua</em> is the <em>Onah</em>
                that precedes the one of the Flagged date, while this opinion holds that a single
                entire day needs to be observed, from sunset to sunset.
                <br />
                For example, if the Flagged Date requires observance of the Night Onah, the <em>Ohr Zarua</em> will be
                for the Day Onah preceding it, but for this opinion, the following Day Onah will need to be observed as well,
                as it is part of the same Jewish Date as the Night Onah.
                <break />
                In Luach, this setting is off by default but it is very important to note
                that most Rabbinic authorities advise to observe this opinion.
            </blockquote>
            <strong>Keep day Thirty One for Onah Beinonis</strong>
            <blockquote>
                This Setting pertains to the <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Dates</a>
                that are generated by each <a href="Entries.html">Entry</a> for someone
                that does not have an active <a href="Kavuahs.html">Vesset Kavuah</a>.
                <br />
                The Flagged Dates that are always generated are the 30th day after the period began,
                the <em>Yom Hachodesh</em>, and the <em>Yom Haflaga</em>.
                <br />
                Most Rabbinic authorities advise to also observe the thirty-first day from the start
                of the period.
                <break />
                It is interesting to note that if the Jewish month in which the period occured was a full month of 30 days
                (about half the Jewish months), it will not matter whether or not one is observing the 31st day,
                as the 31st day will the same day as the <em>Yom Hachodesh</em>.
                <break />
                Due to this settings very widespread prevalence, in Luach, this setting is on by default.

            <strong>Haflaga is only canceled by a longer one</strong>
            <blockquote>
                This Setting pertains to the <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Dates</a>
                that are generated by each <a href="Entries.html">Entry</a> for someone
                that does not have an active <a href="Kavuahs.html">Vesset Kavuah</a>.
                <br />
                These Flagged Dates are: the 30th and 31st days after the period began,
                the <em>Yom Hachodesh</em>, and the <em>Yom Haflaga</em>.
                <br />
                The question arises what happens when there was another <a href="Entries.html">Entry</a>
                in the interim between the period in question and the Flagged Date.
                <br />
                For example, if there was an Entry on the 1st of the month with a Haflaga of 35
                and then another one on the 20th of the month with a Haflaga of 20,
                it is generally agreed that the following 1st of the month should be observed as the <em>Yom Hachodesh</em>.
                <br />
                But does the 30th, 31st and 35th days from previous Entry still get flagged?
                <br />
                The <em>Rem"a"</em> and the <em>T"az"</em> (and the <em>Shulchan Aruch Harav</em>) are of the opinion that the 30th, 31st and 35th days
                from the previous Entry still are observed as the interim periods Haflaga was shorter than 30, 31 and 35.
                <br />
                There are many who disagree (mainly the Ba"ch and the "Sha"ch) and hold that each new period
                cancels the Haflagas of all previous periods even if the new periods Haflaga was shorter.
                <break />
                It is important to note that according to the stricter opinion,
                there can in fact be multiple periods that their <em>Haflagas</em> were never canceled by a longer <em>Haflaga</em>.
                For example, if there were periods with the <em>Haflagas</em> of 36, 35, 33, 32,
                the days that will need to be observed for this last period of 32 will be, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36.
                <br />
                In the above scenario, if the following period had a <em>Haflaga</em> of 37, only 30, 31 and 37 will need to be observed
                as all the others were canceled by the longer <em>Haflaga</em>.
                <break />
                In Luach, this setting is off by default.

            <strong>Continue incrementing Dilug Yom Hachodesh Kavuahs into another month</strong>
            <blockquote>
                This setting pertains to the <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Dates</a>
                generated from <a href="Kavuahs.html">Kavuahs of Dilug Yom Hachodesh</a>.
                <br />
                As these types of Kavuahs add or remove days for each subsequent month,
                they eventually reach either the end or the beginning of the month - dependent upon whether the
                <em>Dilug</em> pattern was incrementing or decrementing days.
                <br />
                The question then arises, do we assume that the pattern will "spill over" into the next or the previous month?
                <br />
                The <em>Chazon Ish zt"l"</em> was of the opinion that once a pattern of <em>Yom Hachodesh</em>
                reaches the end or beginning of the month, the pattern is no longer applicable and the Kavuah can be removed.
                <br />
                Others argue and hold that the pattern spills over into the next or previous month.
                <break />
                In Luach, the default goes with the opinion of the <em>Chazon Ish</em> and once the Kavuah reaches the end
                or beginning of the month it will no longer generate any <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Dates</a>.

                This setting determines whether or not Luach will calculate Haflagas by counting <a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onahs</a>.
                <br />
                This setting is in accordance with the opinion of the <em>Shulchan Aruch Harav</em>.
                <br />
                Many authorities disagree with this interpretation of how to calculate Haflagas (notably, The <em>Nodah B'Yehuda</em>.)

                If this setting is turned on, in addition to the regular Haflaga calculation,

                and add that number of Onahs to the period, and Flag the result as a <em>Haflaga of Onahs</em>.

                <br />
                This pattern is considered a Kavuah in the opinion of the <em>Shulchan Aruch Harav</em> and
                many authorities do not consider this pattern to be a Kavuah
                unless the <a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onahs</a> are the same for all the Entries;

        <h2>Backup and Restore<a name="backup">&nbsp;</a></h2>
        <div class="divList">
            Having all your data backed-up remotely is very helpful in case your device becomes unusable or if you want to transfer this information to another device.
            <br />
            By default, Luach backs up up all of your data and information on a remote server.
            This backup occurs each time you add a new <a href="Entries.html">Entry</a> to your list.
            <br />
            To prevent Luach from automatically backing up your data, turn "off" the "Automatically backup data when a new Entry is added" setting.
            <br />
            <br />
            When you run Luach for the first time, a new account is automatically created for you.
            A randomly generated user name and password are created for your new account.
            <br />
            It is advisable to save these credentials somewhere other than your device in case of device damage or loss.
            <br />
            The account credentials are the way Luach identifies which data backup is yours.
            <br />
            You can find your account credentials on the Settings screen and on the Backup/Restore screen.
            <br />
            To open the Backup/Restore screen, go to the Settings screen and press on the "Backup/Restore" button - which is found at the top right of the Settings Screen.
            <br />
            <br />
            On the Backup/Restore screen, you can create another new account or restore your data.
            <br />
            <br />
            To create another account, simply enter a different user name and password, and press "Create an Account".
            <br />
            After creating an account, you can manually backup all your current local data by pressing on the "Backup my Data" button on the bottom of the screen.
            <br />
            Every time you open the Backup and Restore Screen, Luach automatically logs you in to your account and you are shown the date of the your last backup.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>IMPORTANT NOTES</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>Each account can only have a single remote backup.</em>
                    <br />
                    Each time you backup your data, the previous backup data is overwritten.<br />
                    This means of course, that you can only restore the last backup that you have done.
                    <br />
                    If you wish to have more than a single backup, you will need to create another account by entering different credentials and pressing "Create Account".
                    <br />
                    You can create as many accounts as you need and each account can contain its own backup data.<br />
                    Then to restore the data for any account, enter that accounts credentials on the Backup and Restore page, press &quot;Login to Account&quot;, and then press &quot;Backup my Data&quot;.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Account credentials can not be changed.</em>
                    <br />
                    If you wish to have different account credentials, create another account.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>The remote account is only for backup and restore.</em>
                    <br />
                    Your data is never automatically synchronized between devices - even if both devices are logged in to the same remote account.
                    <br />
                    To move your data over to another device, you need to restore the backup from your remote account.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <strong>What Data is saved in the remote Backup?</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>All of your settings - both Halachic settings and Application settings. (Besides for your "PIN Number", Remote User Name" and "Remote Password")</li>
                <li>Your list of Entries</li>
                <li>Your list of Kavuahs</li>
                <li>Your list of "Tahara Events" such as Mikva, Shaila, and Hefsek Tahara</li>
                <li>Your list of custom Occasions</li>
                <li>Any custom Locations that you may have added or changed</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Restoring from a saved Backup</strong>
            <br />
            If the account you are currently logged in to contains backup data, you will see a "Restore my Data" button on the bottom of the screen.
            <br />
            Press this button to import all the data contained in that backup into Luach.<br />
            <strong>Warning</strong>: this will fully overwrite any and all data currently stored locally in Luach. This action cannot be undone.<br />
        </div>
        <h2>Export your Settings<a name="export">&nbsp;</a></h2>
        <div class="divList">
            You can save your list of Settings outside of Luach by exporting the list.
            <br />
            To do this, press on the Export Data button which is found at the top right of the Settings Screen.
            <br />
            You will shown the Export Data Screen with the Settings option selected.
            <br />
            On the Export Data Screen when you click the "Export to Email" button, your default email client will open up
            in "compose" mode, with an email containing all of your Settings.
            <br />
            In addition, a spreadsheet containing all of your Settings will be attached to the email.
            <br />
            It is advisable to send the email to yourself and to keep it as a  backup of your data.
            <break />
            NOTE: It is not possible to IMPORT your own data into Luach.
            <br />
            If you need to restore your data, it will need to be done manually.
