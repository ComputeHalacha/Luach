                    <strong>Your location</strong>
                    <blockquote>
                        Luach uses your location to determine what time sunset and sunrise are at your location.
                        This is necessary in order to know what the current Jewish Date is.
                        <br />
                        It also is used to display the correct <em>Zmanim</em> on the Zmanim Screen.
                        <br />
                        If your location is in Israel, the <em>Yomim Tovim</em>, <em>Sedra</em> of the week, and Candle Lighting times will be in accordance to the <em>Minhag</em> in <em>Eretz Yisroel</em>.
                        <br />
                        NOTE: Luach remembers your location - and all other settings, even when you close your phone. This information is stored locally.
                        Luach <u>does not</u> send out any information whatsoever.
                        <br />
                        As a matter of fact, the Luach Application does not have any Internet permissions on your device, and is therefore physically unable to connect to a remote server.

                    <strong>Flag previous Onah (The "Ohr Zaruah")</strong>
                    <blockquote>
                        On <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Dates</a>, besides for the actual <em><a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onah</a></em> that needs to be observed,
                        many people also observe the previous <em><a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onah</a></em> as well.
                        <br />
                        This is in accordance with the opinion of the <em>Ohr Zarua</em>.
                        <br />
                        Note, the restrictions will usually be greatly reduced during the Onah of the <em>Ohr Zarua</em>.
                        <br />
                        If you are unsure about if or how to observe the <em>Ohr Zarua</em>, please consult with your Rav.
                        <br />
                        If this setting is turned on, Luach will flag the previous <em><a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onah</a></em> with an indication this it is for the <em>Ohr Zarua</em>.
                        <br />
                        Due to it's widespread prevalence, this Setting is turned on by default.
                    </blockquote>
                    <strong>Keep Onah Beinonis for a full 24 Hours</strong>
                    <blockquote>
                        On <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Dates</a>, there are those that do not keep only the <em><a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onah</a></em> in which the period began, they keep the entire 24 hour period.
                        <br />
                        This is NOT the same as the <em>Ohr Zarua</em> - the previous Onah.
                        The <em>Ohr Zarua</em> is the <em>Onah</em> the precedes the Onah of the Flagged date,
                        while this opinion holds that a single entire day needs to be observed from sunset to sunset.
                        <br />
                        If the period was in the Night Onah, the <em>Ohr Zarua</em> will be the Day Onah preceding the
                        Night, but for this opinion, the Day Onah following the Night Onah needs to be observed as well.
                        <br />
                        In Luach, this setting is off by default.
