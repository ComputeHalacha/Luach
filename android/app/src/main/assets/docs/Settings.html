                This information is stored locally. Luach
                <u>does not</u> send out any information whatsoever.

            <strong>Keep Onah Beinonis for a full 24 Hours</strong>
            <blockquote>
                On <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Dates</a>, there are many that do not observe merely the
                <em><a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onah</a></em>
                in which the period began, they observe the entire 24 hour period.
                <br /> This is NOT the same as the <em>Ohr Zarua</em> - the previous Onah.
                The <em>Ohr Zarua</em> is the <em>Onah</em>
                that precedes the one of the Flagged date, while this opinion holds that a single
                entire day needs to be observed, from sunset to sunset.
                <br />
                For example, if the Flagged Date requires observance of the Night Onah, the <em>Ohr Zarua</em> will be
                for the Day Onah preceding it, but for this opinion, the following Day Onah will need to be observed as well,
                as it is part of the same Jewish Date as the Night Onah.
                <break />
                In Luach, this setting is off by default but it is very important to note

                <br/>
                The Flagged Dates that are always generated are the 30th day after the period began,
                the <em>Yom Hachodesh</em>, and the <em>Yom Haflaga</em>.

                It is interesting to note that if the Jewish month in which the period occured was a full month of 30 days
                (about half the Jewish months), it will not matter whether or not one is observing the 31st day,

            <strong>Haflaga is only canceled by a longer one</strong>
            <blockquote>
                This Setting pertains to the <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Dates</a>
                that are generated by each <a href="Entries.html">Entry</a> for someone
                that does not have an active <a href="Kavuahs.html">Vesset Kavuah</a>.
                <br />
                These Flagged Dates are: the 30th and 31st days after the period began,
                the <em>Yom Hachodesh</em>, and the <em>Yom Haflaga</em>.
                <br />
                The question arises what happens when there was another <a href="Entries.html">Entry</a>
                in the interim between the period in question and the Flagged Date.
                <br />
                For example, if there was an Entry on the 1st of the month with a Haflaga of 35
                and then another one on the 20th of the month with a Haflaga of 20,
                it is generally agreed that the following 1st of the month should be observed as the <em>Yom Hachodesh</em>.
                <br />
                But does the 30th, 31st and 35th days from previous Entry still get flagged?
                <br />
                The <em>Ta"z</em> and the <em>Shulchan Aruch Harav</em> both are of the opinion that the 30th, 31st and 35th days
                from the previous Entry still are observed as the interim periods Haflaga was shorter than 30, 31 and 35.
                <br />
                There are many who disagree (mainly the Sha"ch) and hold that each new period
                cancels the Haflagas of all previous periods even if the new periods Haflaga was shorter.
                <break />
                It is important to note that according to the stricter opinion,
                there can in fact be multiple periods that their <em>Haflagas</em> were never canceled by a longer <em>Haflaga</em>.
                For example, if there were periods with the <em>Haflagas</em> of 36, 35, 33, 32,
                the days that will need to be observed for this last period of 32 will be, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36.
                <br />
                In the above scenario, if the following period had a <em>Haflaga</em> of 37, only 30, 31 and 37 will need to be observed
                as all the others were canceled by the longer <em>Haflaga</em>.
                <break />
                In Luach, this setting is off by default.

            <strong>Continue incrementing Dilug Yom Hachodesh Kavuahs into another month</strong>
            <blockquote>
                This setting pertains to the <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Dates</a>
                generated from <a href="Kavuahs.html">Kavuahs of Dilug Yom Hachodesh</a>.
                <br />
                As these types of Kavuahs add or remove days for each subsequent month,
                they eventually reach either the end or the beginning of the month - dependent upon whether the
                <em>Dilug</em> pattern was incrementing or decrementing days.
                <br />
                The question then arises, do we assume that the pattern will "spill over" into the next or the previous month?
                <br />
                The <em>Chazon Ish zt"l"</em> was of the opinion that once a pattern of <em>Yom Hachodesh</em>
                reaches the end or beginning of the month, the pattern is no longer applicable and the Kavuah can be removed.
                <br />
                Others argue and hold that the pattern spills over into the next or previous month.
                <break />
                In Luach, the default goes with the opinion of the <em>Chazon Ish</em> and once the Kavuah reaches the end
                or beginning of the month it will no longer generate any <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Dates</a>.

            <blockquote>
                This setting determines whether or not Luach will calculate Haflagas by counting <a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onahs</a>.
                <br />
                This setting is in accordance with the opinion of the <em>Shulchan Aruch Harav</em>.
                <br />
                Many authorities disagree with this interpetation of how to calculate Haflagas (notably, The <em>Nodah B'Yehuda</em>.)
                <br />
                If this setting is turned on, in addition to the regular Haflaga calculation,
                Luach will also calculate an additional <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Date</a>
                by counting the Onahs between a period and the one preceding it,
                and add that number of Onahs to the period, and Flag the result as a <em>Haflaga of Onahs</em>.
                <br />
                In addition, Luach will suggest the <a href="Kavuahs.html">Kavuah</a> of
                <em>Haflaga of Onahs</em> as a possible Kavuah.
                <br />
                This Kavuah is set by three periods in a row that started the same number of
                <a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onahs</a> after the period that preceded them.
                <br />
                This pattern is considered a Kavuah in the opinion of the <em>Shulchan Aruch Harav</em> and
                many authorities do not consider this pattern to be a Kavuah
                unless the <a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onahs</a> are the same for all the Entries;
                in which case it will be considered a Haflaga Kavuah.

            <strong>Require PIN to open application</strong>
            <blockquote>
                To protect your personal information, you can require a password any time the Luach application is opened or activated.
            </blockquote>
            <strong>4 digit PIN Number</strong>
            <blockquote>
                This is the 4 digit password that will be required if the Require PIN to open application setting is on.
                <br />
                Warning, DO NOT FORGET THIS PIN NUMBER.
                <br />
                If you forget the PIN number, there is nothing that can be done.
                <br />
                You will need to uninstall Luach and then reinstall it again, and all your information will be lost.
