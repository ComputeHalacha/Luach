            There two types of Settings in Luach.
            <ul>
                <li>Halachic Settings</li>
                <li>Application (non-Halachic) Settings</li>

            <strong>Your location</strong>
            <blockquote>
                Luach uses your location to determine what time sunset and sunrise are at your location. This is necessary in order to know
                what the current Jewish Date is.
                <br /> It also is used to display the correct <em>Zmanim</em> on the Zmanim Screen.
                <br /> If your location is in Israel, the <em>Yomim Tovim</em>, <em>Sedra</em> of the week, and Candle
                Lighting times will be in accordance to the <em>Minhag</em> in <em>Eretz Yisroel</em>.
                <br /> NOTE: Luach remembers your location - and all other settings, even when you close your phone.
                This information is stored locally. Luach
                <u>does not</u> send out any information whatsoever.
                <br /> As a matter of fact, the Luach Application does not have any Internet permissions on your
                device, and is therefore physically unable to connect to a remote server.

            <strong>Flag previous Onah (The "Ohr Zaruah")</strong>
            <blockquote>
                On <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Dates</a>, besides for the actual <em><a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onah</a></em>                        that needs to be observed, many people also observe the previous <em><a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onah</a></em>                        as well.
                <br /> This is in accordance with the opinion of the <em>Ohr Zarua</em>.
                <br /> Note, the restrictions will usually be greatly reduced during the Onah of the <em>Ohr Zarua</em>.
                <br /> If you are unsure about if or how to observe the <em>Ohr Zarua</em>, please consult with your
                Rav.
                <br /> If this setting is turned on, Luach will flag the previous <em><a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onah</a></em>                        with an indication this it is for the <em>Ohr Zarua</em>.
                <br /> Due to it's widespread prevalence, this Setting is turned on by default.

            <strong>Keep Onah Beinonis for a full 24 Hours</strong>
            <blockquote>
                On <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Dates</a>, there are those that do not keep only the <em><a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onah</a></em>                        in which the period began, they keep the entire 24 hour period.
                <br /> This is NOT the same as the <em>Ohr Zarua</em> - the previous Onah. The <em>Ohr Zarua</em>                        is the <em>Onah</em> the precedes the Onah of the Flagged date, while this opinion holds that a single
                entire day needs to be observed from sunset to sunset.
                <br /> If the period was in the Night Onah, the <em>Ohr Zarua</em> will be the Day Onah preceding
                the Night, but for this opinion, the Day Onah following the Night Onah needs to be observed as well.
                <br /> In Luach, this setting is off by default.
            </blockquote>
            <strong>Keep day Thirty One for Onah Beinonis</strong>
            <blockquote>
                Besides for the thirtieth day, there are many who also keep the thirty first day from the start of the period.
                <br />
                It is interesting to note that if the Jewish month that period was in, had 30 days
                (about half the Jewish months), it will not matter whether or not one is observing the 31st day,
                as the 31st day will the same day as the <em>Yom Hachodesh</em>.
                <br />                
                In Luach, this setting is on by default.
