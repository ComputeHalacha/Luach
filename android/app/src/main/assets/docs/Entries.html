        <p>In Luach, an <em>Entry</em> is a euphemism for a period. (The Halachic term for a period is a "seeing" - ראיה).</p>
        <p>
            Entries are the most basic piece of information that needs to be retained in order to keep a valid Halachic
            calendar.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of keeping track of entries is threefold:
            <ol>
                <li>To keep track of when a Hefsek Tahara can be done.</li>
                <li>To calculate which days of the following month need to be observed as <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Days</a>.</li>
                <li>To calculate <a href="Kavuahs.html">Kavuahs</a>.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Luach uses the list of Entries to automatically calculate the
            <a href="FlaggedDates.html">Flagged Dates</a> and possible <a href="Kavuahs.html">Kavuahs</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Entry Properties</h3>
        The following are the properties that make up an Entry:
        <div class="divList">
            <strong>Jewish Date</strong>
            <blockquote>The day, month and year of the Jewish Date for the beginning of the period.</blockquote>
            <strong>Onah</strong>
            <a name="Onahs">&nbsp;</a>
            <blockquote>
                Each Jewish day is divided into two "<em>Onahs</em>"; the Night <em>Onah</em> and the Day <em>Onah</em>.
                <p>
                    If the period began between sunset and sunrise, the Entry is considered to have occurred during the Night <em>Onah</em>.
                    If it began between sunrise and sunset, it is considered to have occurred during the Day <em>Onah</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luach is able to give you the time of sunset and sunrise for any location around the globe for any date. Make sure that you
                    have selected your current location on the Settings Screen, and that your device has the correct
                    time and time zone for your location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the time of the start of the period is close to the time of sunset or sunrise (within about 15 minutes), it is strongly
                    advisable to contact your Rav to help determine the correct date and <em>Onah</em> for that Entry.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <strong>Haflaga</strong><a name="haflaga">&nbsp;</a>
            <blockquote>
                The <em>Haflaga</em> is the number of days (or partial days) between the previous Entry and this
                one. Upon the addition of an Entry, Luach automatically works out the <em>Haflaga</em> from the previous
                Entry.
            </blockquote>
        </div>
        <h3>Add New Entry</h3>
        There are two ways to add New Entries into Luachs Entry list:
        <ol>
            <li>
                On <a href="MainScreen.html">The Main Screen</a> or the <a href="#MonthView">Month View Screen</a>,
                navigate to the Jewish date for the day the period began, and press on the New Entry button.
                <br /> The New Entry Screen will open, with that date selected.
            </li>
            <li>
                From the main menu on the right, press on the Entries button to open the <a href="Entries.html">Entries List Screen</a>
                and then press on the New Entry button.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Non-Vesset Entries</h3>
        <p>
            It is very important to note that not every seeing is considered a Halachic Vesset Entry.
            <br /> For example, staining and the like are usually not considered Halachic Entries even those that
            require the Niddah restrictions.
            <br /> Any seeing is not a regular monthly period, needs Rabbinic determination whether or not to record
            it as a regular Entry.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/NewEntry_Advanced.png" style="float:right;margin:5px 0 5px 5px;" /> In Luach, when an
            Entry is added, by default, it is assumed to be a regular period. In cases where it was determined that
            it should not be recorded as a regular Entry, Luach has two special options that can be set for each
            Entry.
            <br /> On the New Entry Screen, just above the "Add Entry" button, press on "Show Advanced Entry Options".
            <br />Two special advanced options will appear that can be set for this Entry:
            <ol>
                <li>Not a Halachic Vesset period. Should not generate Flagged Dates</li>
                <li>Ignore this Entry in Kavuah calculations</li>
            </ol>
            If you have reason to believe that the current Entry should not be registered as a regular period but you do not fully understand
            these advanced options, leave them alone for now and consult your Rabbi.
        </p>
        <h3>"Out of Pattern" Entries</h3>
        <p>
            If there is a <a href="Kavuahs.html">Kavuah</a> that is active and that is set to <a href="Kavuahs.html" #CancelOnahBeinonis">Cancel Onah Beinonis</a>,
            whenever an Entry is added or edited, Luach checks to assure that the new Entry is not "Out of Pattern".
            <br />
            If the new Entry does not match the pattern set by the Kavuah, Luach will ask if you wish to remove the
            <a href="Kavuahs.html" #CancelOnahBeinonis">Cancel Onah Beinonis</a> property for that Kavuah.
        </p>
        <h3>The Entry List Screen</h3><a href="EntryListScreen">&nbsp;</a>
        <p>The list of Entries that have been added can be viewed from the Entries List Screen.</p>
        <p>
            In the Entry List, the Entries are shown sorted to show the most recent Entries on top and the oldest ones
            on the bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
            To assist in giving a glancing overview of the Entry list trends, each Entries background color (dark or light) is set according
            to which <a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onah</a> it occurred in.
            <br /> The icon shown by each Entry is also either a sun or a moon according to the Entries Onah.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each Entry has the following option buttons:
        </p>
        <div class="divList">
            <strong>Go To Date</strong>
            <blockquote>Pressing this will take you to the Jewish calendar date when the Entry started.</blockquote>
            <strong>Edit</strong>
            <blockquote>
                This will take you to the Edit Entry Screen, to change any of the Entry's properties (including the advanced ones).
                <br /> This option will not be shown for an Entry that is the <em><a href="Kavuahs.html#SettingEntry">Setting Entry</a></em>                        for a Kavuah.
            </blockquote>
            <strong>New Kavuah</strong>
            <blockquote>
                This will take you to the New Kavuah screen to add a new <a href="Kavuahs.html">Kavuah</a>.
                <br /> For this new Kavuah, this Entry will be used as it's <em><a href="Kavuahs.html#SettingEntry">Setting Entry</a></em>.
            </blockquote>
            <strong>Remove</strong>
            <blockquote>
                This will totally remove this Entry from the list.<br /> Once removed, it is gone. The only way to
                add it again, is to add it as a New Entry.
                <br /> If any <a href="Kavuahs.html">Kavuahs</a> have this Entry set as their <em><a href="Kavuahs.html#SettingEntry">Setting Entry</a></em>                        these Kavuahs will be removed as well.
                <br /> Before deleting any Entries or Kavuahs, Luach will ask you to confirm the removal.
            </blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="well">
            <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>
            <br /> If you remove or change an Entry that was one of the Entries used in calculating a <a href="Kavuahs.html">Kavuah</a>                    but is NOT the final <em><a href="Kavuahs.html#SettingEntry">Setting Entry</a></em> for that Kavuah,
            removing that Entry will not remove or change that Kavuah in Luach's Kavuah List.
            <br /> It is therefore suggested whenever removing or changing an Entry, to look over the Kavuah List
            to make sure that none of them needs to be changed, removed or added.
