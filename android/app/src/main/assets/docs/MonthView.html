        <h3>Special Icons</h3>
        <p>
            The Month View also shows information about the day by the use of special icons.
            <br />
            Here are the explanations as to what these icons may be and what they indicate.
        </p>
        <div class="divList" style="margin-top:20px;">
            <strong>Hefsek Tahara Icon</strong>
            <div style="color:#8c8;font-size:25px;" class="icon-flare">
            </div>
            <blockquote>
                This icon is shown on the day that a <em>Hefsek Tahara</em> was done.
                <br />
                To add a Hefsek Tahara Icon, go to the <a href="MainScreen.html">Main Screen</a> for this day by
                pressing on the day, and then press on the Hefsek Tahara Button from the daily menu, or
                if the day is fifth day after the start of an <a href="Entries.html">Entry</a>, press the Possible Hefsek Tahara Indicator.
                <br />
                To remove a Hefsek Tahara Icon, from the <a href="MainScreen.html">Main Screen</a>,
                press on the Hefsek Tahara Badge.
                <break />
                If you do not want Luach to show this indication, you can turn off the
                "Show Entry, Hefsek Tahara and Mikvah information" setting from the
                <a href="Settings.html">Settings</a> screen.

            <strong>Shailah Icon</strong>
            <div style="color:#f1d484;font-size:25px;" class="icon-report-problem">
            </div>
            <blockquote>
                If there is a Halachic question such as a <em>Bedikah</em> that needs a Rabbinic decision etc.,
                Luach allows you to mark the date with a <em>Shailah</em>.
                <br />
                This will help to remind you about this question before going to the Mikvah etc.
                <br />
                A <em>Shailah</em> Icon can be added on any date even those that are not part of <em>Shiva Neki'im</em>.
                <br />
                To add the Shailah Icon, go to the <a href="MainScreen.html">Main Screen</a> for this day by
                pressing on the day, and then press on the Shailah Button from the daily menu.
                <br />
                To remove a Shailah Icon, from the <a href="MainScreen.html">Main Screen</a>,
                press on the Shailah Badge.

                <a href="Settings.html">Settings</a> screen.

            <strong>Mikvah Icon</strong>
            <div style="color:#99f;font-size:25px;" class="icon-beenhere">

            <blockquote>
                The Mikvah Icon is shown on the day of the Mikvah night as an indication that
                the Mikvah was attended.
                <br />
                To add the Mikvah Icon, go to the <a href="MainScreen.html">Main Screen</a> for this day by
                pressing on the day, and then press on the Mikvah Button from the daily menu, or
                if the day is the seventh day of <em>Shiva Neki'im</em>, press the Possible Mikvah Night Indicator.

                To remove a Mikvah Icon, from the <a href="MainScreen.html">Main Screen</a>,

                <break />
                <strong>Important Note:</strong> As the Mikvah is attended to only AFTER nightfall
                on the 7th day of the <em>Shiva Neki'im</em>,
                the true Jewish Date for the Mikvah night is the next day after
                the end of <em>Shiva Neki'im</em>.
                <br />
                As most people don't look at the Mikvah night as being on the next day,
                it was decided in Luach to
                show all Mikvah indicators on the last day of the <em>Shiva Neki'im</em>.
                <break />
                If you do not want Luach to show this indication, you can turn off the
                "Show Entry, Hefsek Tahara and Mikvah information" setting from the
                <a href="Settings.html">Settings</a> screen.

                You can view the Event by pressing the date to go to the
