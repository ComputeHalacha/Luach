            A Flagged Date is an <a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onah</a> that probably needs to be observed with <em>Harchaka</em> restrictions (הרחקות).
            <br />
            Luach shows Flagged dates for all the past <a href="Entries.html">Entries</a> and <a href="Kavuahs.html">Kavuahs</a> in the Entry List
            and any future Flagged Dates that can be calculated up until the number of months set in the <a href="Settings.html#numberMonthsAheadToWarn">Setting "Number of Months Ahead To Warn"</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Luach DOES NOT show Flagged Dates that are within 11 days after a period Entry.
            <br />
            This is to prevent clogging up the calendar with dates that are irrelevant - as 11 days is the
            absolute minimum number of days that need to be observed after the start of the period.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are a few different situations that cause Flagged dates.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The 30th day after the beginning of a period.
                    <br />
                    On this day, some observe only the same <a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onah</a> that the period began and others keep the entire day.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The same day of the month as a period for the month following a period. This is known as the <em>Yom Hachodesh</em>.
                    <br />
                    On this day, some observe only the same <a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onah</a> that the period began and others keep the entire day.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The<a name="Haflaga">&nbsp;</a>day that is the same number of days after the previous period as the interval between that period and the one before it.
                    <br />
                    This is known as the <em>Yom Haflaga</em>.
                    <br />
                    To calculate the <em>Yom Haflaga</em>, both days that the period started upon them are counted.
                    <br />
                    So for example, if one period started on the 1st if the month and the next one started on the 15th of the month,
                    this is a <em>Haflaga</em> of 15.
                    <br />
                    In this case, the 29th of the month needs to be observed as the <em>Yom Haflaga</em>.
                    <br />
                    On this day, some observe only the same <a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onah</a> that the period began and others keep the entire day.
                </li>
                <li>There are many that also observe the 31st day after the beginning of a period</li>
                <li>
                    If there is an active <a href="Kavuahs.html">Kavuah</a>, it will generate Flagged Dates.
                    <br />
                    Which dates need to be observed, depend on the type of Kavuah.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            On the <a href="TodayScreen.html">Today Screen</a>, any Flagged Dates will be colored in be yellow and a red flag will be shown.
            <br />
            The flag can be pressed to view the details for this Flagged Date.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the <a href="MonthView.html">Month View Screen</a> as well, any Flagged Dates will have a yellow colored background.
        </p>
        <h3>The Flagged Dates Screen</h3>
        <p>
            This screen shows all the upcoming Flagged Dates.
            <br />
            The number of months in advance shown is dependent upon the <em>Number of Months ahead to warn</em> setting which can be set from the <a href="Settings.html">Settings Screen</a>.
            <br />
            For each Flagged Date, the background color (dark or light) is set according
            to which <a href="Entries.html#Onahs">Onah</a> needs to be kept for it.
            <br />
            The icon shown by each Flagged Date is also either a sun or a moon according to the Onah.
            <br />
            Each Flagged Date in the Flagged Date Screen will have an action link to go to its date.
